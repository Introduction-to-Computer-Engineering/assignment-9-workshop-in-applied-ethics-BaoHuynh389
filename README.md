### Two main points

1. Ethics is not about your beliefs, habits, and predilections, but about a **group's consensus on what is the right behavior** of its members that will ensure optimal operation and longevity, whatever the domain or subject matter of interest of the group. 	

2. Ethics can be about everything and anything, but it **requires whole-system analysis** in every case.


### Answer the Questions


Ethics is, in general, the views and common moral standards that society defines, such as the rules of civilized conduct in the workplace, the law. Ethics comes from a social point of view, so ethics can change in different contexts

https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics

1. If all people were ethical in all their interactions, which centerpiece of modern society would be obviated?
-  in general, Ethics is the views and common moral standards that society defines, such as the rules of civilized conduct in the workplace, the law. therfore, Ethics comes from a social point of view, so ethics can change in different contexts. Any general views and ethical standards that violate social definitions, such as civilized codes of conduct in the workplace, may change in different contexts.
- If all people were ethical in all their interactions, the justice system or judicial system in my opinion would not be necessary and thus removed. Punishments/ consequences in the name of justice, would be obviated because there would be no unethical behaviors.

2. Ethics creates a dichotomy between the comfort of the individual and the longevity, or mere existance, of the group. Give an example of an extreme case from recent history that favored the group to the detriment of the individual. How would you embed the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself? Be specific.
- An example: During medieval times in Europe, science rejected the religious views created to maintain power and position in society. So scientists at that time were considered paganism and arrested by the church. The scientific evidence was rejected or destroyed, the purpose of this is to help the church control the people easily and to reap the benefits of money donation, and to strengthen the power to rule the country. This is an example of an extreme case from recent history favors the group that is detrimental to the individual.

- the principle of balance of the interests of the individual and the group into the ethical code itself was made based on the interest in both side. Which mean, In order to balance the interests of individuals and groups into the moral code itself, the benefits simultaneously must be shared and approved from both sides.

3. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). An ethical code relies on the _cooperation_ of the individuals. Discuss how rogue behavior (aka _defection_) with respect to the ethical code of a group gives rise to the [prinsoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) and the eventual demise of the ethical code. What incentives can you build in the ethical code that would counteract the attractiveness of defection and, as a result, would mitigate the danger to the code?
- Cheating behavior with respect to the ethical code of a group can bring down other members to act in such bad behavior and possibly lead up to the disregarding the whole system of ethics implemented the group. Or it can cause conflicts between members and upset the group, which can lead to all sorts of problems about truthful and interest conflict.


### Class Activities
_Note: Class activities are group but individual submissions are required for grading._
 
1. In a small group up to 5 people, imagine you are a small _tech_ startup. Then:
   1. List the group members below
   - List the group members below.
- Jorge T
- Jesus CM
- Bao H
- Mustafa A
- Logan P
- Jackie W

   2. Pick a president and write their name below.
   - Logan P
   
   3. Describe your technical innovation below.
   - Fully immersed Virtual Realit. Shuts down bodily function and creates a virtual world inside your mind to make the feeling of virtual reality feel more realistic.
   
2. Describe the ways your innovation, if realized, would affect society. 
   1. Below, list at least 3 adverse effects (including but not limited to _misuse_) of the innovation and anticipatory actions and mechanisms you can embed that
- Lack of real world interaction: Limit time one can use the tech at a time
- Harmful to body health: Lock hardware until certain amount of body care is performed
- Possibly hacking into others headsets, glitches, etc.: Safeguards in the code, if somebody tries to hack into it, it'll shut down
- Potential long term effect on brain: Taking breaks, making sure people spend more time irl than in the game.
- Negative psychological effects: COmputer program that serves as a therapist.
- Surronding enviornment isuues: Notifications for dangers detected around user body
   
   2. Below, give an _explicit_ definition of the fine line between the benefit and detriment of your innovation at two moments of its lifetime: 
   (i) immediately upon launch; 
- Benefit: Having an alternate reality
- Detriment: Becoming inapt to the real world due to spending too much time. (ii) after enough time for it to be absorbed into everyday life.
- Benefit: A society is built withing the software that is thenintergrated into our real world society, providing jobs and other opportunities to people.
- Detriment: Brings down social interaction IRL and possibly deevolves our society
   
   
3. Your small "[band of merry psychopaths](#the-band)" are the pivotal social kernel that can define the proper use of your technology. You have to start early, and hold the line. How are you going to ensure that you stay the course? 
   1. Below, define a Code of Ethics (aka Code of Conduct) for your organization that will safeguard your original intentions and values while not stiflying innovation as your startup grows and matures. Your code should have _at most 9 points_.
   
- All decisions to the code of conduct must be unanimous, this rule cannot be changed.
- No one person will have full control over the product.
- Private user data can not be sold for profit by any team member.
- All items in the company shall be confidential, unless otherwise noted.
- A team member must remove themselves from product if there is a conflict of interest.
- Be respectful to other team members and company property.
- Team members are responsible for ensuring the product is as safe as it can be. Failure to ensure product safety will result in evalutation of skills.
- Breaking any part of the code of conduct will be subject to evaluation which may result in immediate termination.


4. **(BONUS)** Ethical codes are vulnerable to _hostile takeover_ of the adopting organization. Pick one person from your group and let them _remove 3 points_ from your Code, at their discretion, to be the most damaging overall.
 - removed point:
3. Private user data must stay confidential, and can not be sold for profit by any team members.
4. All items/ technology in the company shall be confidential, unless otherwise noted.
8. A person breaking any part of the code of conduct, will be subject to evaluation which may result in immediate termination.

   1. Below, discuss how and why the Code has been weakened.
   -  The code was immedieatly weaked because any consequence was removed from the actual code. It also lets employess profit from confidential material.
   -  The first point removed was, "Private user data must stay confidential, and can not be sold for profit by any team." So now without this picece in place, private and personal data can be distributed anywhere, with money even allowed as an exchange for data. Second, like the first point, it has to do with confidentiality, it states: "All items/ technology in the company shall be confidential, (unless otherwise noted)". Without this point, verbal and physical descriptions of our standing technologies at our company will be spread around. Which allows competition and bad people to recreate or alter our technologeis.
   
   2. Below, discuss how, in retrospect, you should have stated the points of the Code, to make it _robust to disruption_. _Note: Beware of the [paradox of self-amendment](https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/psaessay.htm), which, in short, **"...arises when a rule is used as the authority for its own amendment. It is sharper when the rule of change is supreme, sharper still when it is changed into a form that is inconsistent with its original form, and sharpest of all when the change purports to be irrevocable."**_
   
   - In our code, we wrote a rule where all changes to the code of conduct must be unanimous and that that rule could not be changed. Rules like this make the code of conduct harder to weaken. However, we could have also gave more specific definitions and detailed expectations.


#### The Band
The derogatory expression _band of merry psychopaths_ is used in writing to refer to a small _group of irresponsible or deliberately hostile people with a lot of power_ to affect the world around them.
